Transmits a ukhasnet-style packet on 869.500 MHz from a HackRF.

Usage: ukhasnet_tx "packet content"

Test reception with RTL-SDR:

rtl_fm -f 869500000 -s 64k -g 48 -p 162 | UKHASnet-decoder/UKHASnet-decoder -v -s 64000

If it receives wrong sync D255 instead of 2DAA
then all bits in packet have to be inverted

#define INVERT_BITS  (1)
